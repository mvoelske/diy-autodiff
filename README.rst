Automatic Differentiation from Scratch in Python
================================================

This repository contains an extremely basic machine learning framework with automatic differentiation in a couple lines of plain Python.

With inspiration from [Baydin2018]_.

There's no support for vectorization or GPUs. Performance will be terrible.

See `demo.py <demo.py>`_ for a usage example.
